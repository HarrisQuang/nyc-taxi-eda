    "\n",
    "A taxi company tackle a problem is how to assign the cabs to passengers efficiently. One of main issue is determining the duration of the current trip so it can predict when the cab will be free for the next trip. You are challenged to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Your primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. To build the best model, you would do analysis to find the best features that have relative with trip duration of taxi. In this project, you will practice data analysis and data visualization skill using Python such as: describe the data, handle missing value, data cleansing, feature engineer, feature selection to get insights about the data and determine how different variables are dependent on the target variable **Trip Duration**.\n",
